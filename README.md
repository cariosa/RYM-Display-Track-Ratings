# RYM-Display-Track-Ratings
A Userscript that displays individual track ratings, genres, and track rankings on RateYourMusic album or any release pages.

These details are typically reserved for premium users. It also works on firefox mobile.

To prevent excessive usage and potential rate limiting, please use this userscript judiciously. It caches data for 7 days by default (you can adjust this duration by modifying the CACHE_EXPIRATION variable). This caching mechanism helps minimize the risk of hitting rate limits or getting your IP blocked. You can easily clear the cache by clicking the 'Clear Cache' button, and refresh the data by selecting 'Load Track Ratings' to obtain the latest information.
